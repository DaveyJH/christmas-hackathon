[Here is a link to the final project](https://daveyjh.github.io/holiday-hamper/)

This site was built by team Happy Holiday Hackers for the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) December 2021 Hackathon, with the theme of Happy Holidays. It was built to be a resource for information on holidays around the globe, from all walks of life and all times of the year. Due to the time constraints of the Hackathon, we will be focusing on the holidays around December for now. It is designed to be responsive on a wide range of devices, whilst also being easy to navigate through.

## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

We wanted this project to be as inclusive as possible. As the main holidays in each country are often related to religion, and we wanted to ensure that we were creating a site that was inclusive for people of all faiths, including atheists and agnostics. We wanted to create a resource for information on holidays around the globe, from all walks of life and all times of the year. We discussed the scope of this, and decided that, due to the time contraints of a Hackathon, we'd focus on the holidays that take place around December to start with, with the plan to expand this once the Hackathon has finished. We also want to add an interactive element to encourage education across a wide variety of cultures.

### User Stories

## Design

### Color Scheme

* We have stuck with a fairly minimal colour scheme:
  * Red
  * Yellow
  * Black
  * White
* We chose these colours to link with the festive theme of the site, as red and yellow are often used in celebration.
* Black and white were used to ensure good colour contrast across the site.
* The entire site has a colour contrast that is AA compliant in accordance with the WCAG Colour Contrast Guidelines.

### Typography

* We have used sans-serif fonts throughout the site, except for the header logo text. This is because sans-serif is accessibility friendly, as it is easily readable to users with dyslexia.
* [Dancing Script](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dancing+Script) has been used for the header logo text, with a fallback font of sans-serif is used as the default backup font in cases where these fonts have difficulty loading. This font was chosen for it's holiday-feel. We decided to go with a non-sans-serif font for the header logo text, as it's not an important piece of text.

### Imagery

* Most images used on the site are from the specific holiday that they're linked to.
* The holiday pages have a black background with sparkles on it, to link with the festive theme, without requiring a different background for every holiday.
* The favicon is a gift, wrapped in a sparkly blue wrapping paper with a gold bow, to link with the festive theme.
* The site logo was made by our team, which consists of a picnic hamper, with various holiday-related items inside it.
